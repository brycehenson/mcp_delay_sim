# mcp_delay
Calculating mcp timing spread based on geometric calculations

 **Figure 1**- The Metastable Helium atoms have a varied propagation distance from the surface of the mcp untill they strike on the side of the slanted mcp holes. |

 **Figure 2**- Ray tracing alows the distribution to be calculated. |
